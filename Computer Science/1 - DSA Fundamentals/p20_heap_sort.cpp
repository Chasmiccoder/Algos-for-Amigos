Heap Sort:
==========

Representing Binary Trees using Arrays -
Consider the following tree   5
                             / \
                            /   \
                           2     9
                          / \   / \
                         3   1 4   6
Using the convention,
if Root Node = i,
Left Node    = 2 * i + 1, 
Right Node   = 2 * i + 2
Where i is the array index (starting from 0)

The tree will be = [ 5, 2, 9, 3, 1, 4, 6 ]

A binary tree which can be represented in it's array format without spaces is a complete binary tree.
A Max Heap is a complete binary tree with the condition that the parent node always has an element
that is greater than or equal to its child nodes. (It is the other way around for Min Heaps)
The process of converting a binary tree into a heap efficiently is called heapify.

Max Heapifying the given example:
Start with the last element (nth node), and go backwards, while converting the node's subtree into a max heap
Note that leaf nodes are already max heaps. This happens in the max_heapify() function
                                                (Recursively Heapify until All Subtrees are Max Heaps)

     5                5                5                9                9
    / \     (9)      / \     (2)      / \     (5)      / \     (5)      / \
   /   \     =>     /   \     =>     /   \     =>     /   \     =>     /   \
  2     9          2     9          3     9          3     5          3     6
 / \   / \        / \   / \        / \   / \        / \   / \        / \   / \
3   1 4   6      3   1 4   6      2   1 4   6      2   1 4   6      2   1 4   5

Now, swap the root node [9] (which is the largest element in the list) with the last node [5], and then 
'cut' the leaf node. In the code, the first element is swapped with the last element, and the 'size' of
the array considered as the binary tree is reduced by 1. This happens in the heap_sort() function.
Re-heapify the binary tree, and eliminate the largest element in the tree after each recursive call. 


This way, the largest elements in the binary tree get eliminated and put at the end, which
results in an array sorted in ascending order.


Heap Sort is an Unstable Sorting Algorithm, which means that if there are repititions in the initial array,
the sorted array may not contain those repetitions in the same order.
Also, heap sort is not as fast as merge sort, or quick sort.

Time Complexity = O(nlogn)
Space Complexity = O(n)    With the recursive approach
Space Complexity = O(1)    With the iterative approach
